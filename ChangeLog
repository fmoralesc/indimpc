  * indimpc.py: Add command-line option "-s" to display summary  Allow for
  showing the notification on-demand.  Useful to see the status of MPD without
  waiting for an MPD-specific event, such as pausing, or a change of song, etc.

2011-07-11  Felipe Morales <hel.sheep@gmail.com>

  dialog, which has also been modified.

2011-07-08  Felipe Morales <hel.sheep@gmail.com>

  * README.md: Updated documentation.

  * indimpc.py: Falling back to python-keybinder if gnome-settings-daemon isn't
  usable for grabbing the multimedia keys.

  * .gitignore, indimpc.py: made the preferences button a bit more appealing.
  still not correct, though (it should use the "gtk-properties" icon, but it
  refuses to do so)

  * indimpc.py: The preferences dialog can be opened by passing "-p" as an
  argument.

  * indimpc.py, indimpc.rc: Multimedia keys grabbing is now a toggleable

  * indimpc.py: Better way to deal with missing config options  A user may want
  to configure [Client], but keep using $MPD_HOST rather than [MPD].

  * indimpc.py: Use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME if set  Most often this will point to
  ~/.config, but better do it properly anyway.  Also, if a path was given on
  the command line, it would have already been expanded by shell; no need to do
  it again.

  * indimpc.py: Don't silently ignore nonexistent custom config file  If user
  explicitly provided a different configuration, it's better to explicitly
  notify of failures too.

2011-07-07  Felipe Morales <hel.sheep@gmail.com>

  * indimpc.py: fixing typo in IndiMPDPreferencesDialog.write_config

  * indimpc.py: Adding entry for password in preferences dialog.  Fixing frame
  style in preferences dialog.

  * indimpc.py, indimpc.rc: Fixing most of issues #2 & #3. Configuration should
  be gathered from $MPD_HOST and $MPD_PORT, in case
  ~/.config/indimpc/indimpc.rc doesn't exist. indimpc.rc overrides the
  environment variables.
